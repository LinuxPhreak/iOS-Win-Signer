iOS-Win-Signer
==============

iOS Win Signer is intended to be a GUI front end to the OpenSSL method of create ipa signing keys inside of Windows. 

The requirements for using the iOS Win Signer are listed below. 

<ul>
<li>Microsoft .Net Framework 2.0</li>
<li>OpenSSL for Window</li>
<li>iTunes Developer Account</li>
</ul>

All of the above with the acception of the iTunes developer account is absolutely free. Apple charges $100.00 for a developer account. 

Please note the iOS Win Signer will not submit your iOS App to the iOS App Store. It is simply intended to help you sign your IPA files so you can successfully build your iOS App using Phone Gap.

<strong>Note:</strong> As of right now this is a fully functioning Windows program. You should be able to just download the source code and build it and it should work. If you want a prebuilt version of the program please don't hesitate to ask. I will soon offer the binary file for download on my website.
